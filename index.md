# Welcome to Hayley Drozd's website

I am an MD-PhD candidate in the Indiana University School of Medicine Medical Scientist Training Program. My clinical interests are in Pediatrics, particularly Neurodevelopmental Disorders. My PhD project investigates the mechanisms underlying ADHD in Neurofibromatosis Type 1, using a preclinical model to incorporate approaches such as behavioral neuroscience, pharmacology, optogenetics, in vivo multiwire electrode recordings, and computational neuroscience.
